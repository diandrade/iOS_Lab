# iOS Lab Course Projects

These projects were developed as part of the **iOS Lab** course, where I explored core iOS development concepts. Below are the topics covered and the corresponding projects:

1. **Variables** - Understanding variable declaration, initialization, and usage in Swift.
2. **Types** - Exploring different data types and how they are used in iOS apps.
3. **Arrays** - Creating and manipulating arrays to store collections of data.
4. **Conditionals** - Implementing conditional logic using `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.
5. **Optionals** - Working with optional values, unwrapping, and optional binding.
6. **Error Handlers** - Handling errors with `try`, `catch`, and custom error types.
7. **Loops** - Using loops like `for-in`, `while`, and `repeat-while` to iterate over collections or execute tasks multiple times.
8. **Functions** - Defining and using functions for modular code with parameters and return values.
9. **Enumerations** - Defining and using enumerations to group related values and manage state.
10. **Classes** - Creating classes with properties and methods to define objects in Swift.
11. **Structs** - Understanding the differences between classes and structs and using structs for lightweight data structures.
12. **Protocols** - Defining and implementing protocols to ensure conformity across types.
13. **Delegate** - Implementing the delegate pattern to allow one object to communicate with another.
